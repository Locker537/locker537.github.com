&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/phishing.png" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Phishing Logo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in my career, I was an active naysayer against “security awareness training.” The idea that we could train every employee in the company to actively identify phishing emails and never fall victim didn’t just seem improbable; I thought it was impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Well, the attacker only needs one person to fall victim and click that suspicious link or open that sketchy word document, and they gain access to our network. Meanwhile, we, as security defenders, need to be perfect! We can’t make any mistakes... and neither can our employees!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn’t seem realistic to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of investing in education and training, I wanted to build technical solutions to security problems. I thought investing resources in technically enforcing security policy would take the human error out of the equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I wasn’t in charge. At my previous workplaces, we invested heavily in security training and user education over the years, in spite of my point of view. We trained employees to identify phishing emails and other threats and report them to our internal security team. Sure enough, the emails and reports flowed in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I realized I was wrong. The results of employee education and training were overwhelmingly strong. On more than one occasion, an employee-reported email led to the detection and prevention of a targeted attack. That same attack had bypassed all of our email filtering solutions and intrusion detection systems, which included capabilities to “detonate” and inspect URLs and file attachments. The humans beat the machines handily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we used trends in reporting to help understand who (human resources, finance, engineering, etc) was being targeted and when. With this information, we were able to improve our security training and phishing prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This experience taught me that there is deep value in treating your users as your front-line defense. You should, of course, have technology that can facilitate the detection and remediation of any threats that make it through your human and machine barriers, but there is no substitute for strong user education, and especially for training your users to spot and report suspicious emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Getting Started with User training&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so all that sounds good in theory. But getting started with security awareness training is often the hardest part. We suggest leveraging free training materials, including our &lt;a href="https://strongarm.io/blog/tips-to-spot-phishing/"&gt;own short guide to spotting phishing emails&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, the Government of Canada has compiled &lt;a href="https://www.getcybersafe.gc.ca/index-eng.aspx"&gt;free security training resources&lt;/a&gt; including a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TRR6lHviQc"&gt;three-minute video&lt;/a&gt; to introduce the skills needed to thwart phishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of this training includes instructing your employees to forward suspicious emails to your IT and security team. We suggest creating an email distribution list, security@&lt;your-company-domain&gt; specifically for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Analyzing Employee-Reported Emails&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you are in a place where employees are forwarding suspicious emails to your IT and security team, you need to work on a process to analyze them and provide feedback to the employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis process can be very complicated, but again, starting with a simple approach is best. Check our guide for &lt;a href="https://strongarm.io/blog/tips-to-spot-phishing/"&gt;spotting phishing emails&lt;/a&gt;, and pay attention to unexpected email senders and mismatched links. If you have a dedicated analysis environment where you can safely visit the suspicious URLs, do so; the intent of the email often reveals itself in the form of &lt;a href="https://strongarm.io/blog/docusign-phishes/"&gt;credential theft&lt;/a&gt; or other attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have determined if the email is indeed malicious, it’s time to respond to the employee who reported it. Thank them and provide them with enough information to reinforce the value of their diligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Taking Training and Education to the Next Level&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, you need a strategy to prevent your employees, specifically those “happy clickers” inside your company who will click on just about anything, from falling victim to threats. You can do this by blocking access to bad domains used in suspicious emails. This can often be done in your firewalls and web proxies, but the best way to do it is via your DNS. If you are a Strongarm customer, we have you covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, you will start to see trends in both the type and intent of suspicious emails being sent to your business, as well as your employees’ increasing ability to spot and report them. This information helps inform where and how to improve security. For example, if you are often targeted with credential theft attacks, it may be worthwhile to invest in improving password strategies and implementing &lt;a href="https://strongarm.io/blog/password-best-practices/"&gt;password management solutions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if you find only a certain team, like those pesky folks in sales, are routinely falling victim to phishing, it may be worth creating some training specifically for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/passwords.png" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Passwords Image"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we’ve explained before, attackers generally want one of two things when they attack you online: money or information. To get to either of those goals, they often want to steal your usernames and passwords, also known as credentials. Once an attacker has your credentials, they have an all-access pass. This is why you want to understand and use password best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Attackers Target Credentials&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attackers want to steal credentials so that they can get money or information. They steal your username and password, with the goal of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using your email to impersonate you and trick your peers and colleagues into doing something the attacker benefits from (i.e. authorizing a wire transfer to the attacker’s bank)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using your credentials to gain access to your business’ network remotely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using your credentials to access and steal your company’s data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, you don’t want any of that to happen. So how can you make it as hard as possible for attackers to access your coveted credentials?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Password Best Practices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are six recommendations to keep your passwords safe and protected from attackers with bad intentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Use Strong Passwords&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably heard this advice before, but you might not know this helpful hack for creating strong passwords you can remember. Long phrases and sentences that are easy for you to remember, but hard for computers and attackers to guess, make great passwords, as &lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/936/"&gt;this comic&lt;/a&gt; illustrates. For example, the passphrase “wherever leather frame biggest” is easy for you to remember, but challenging for a computer or adversary to guess, because it’s long and nonsensical. Conversely, the password “S3cretS@uc3” might look like a good, complex password, but it’s hard for you to remember and much easier for a computer to guess, since it’s short and uses obvious patterns to replace vowels with symbols. When it comes to password strength, the length of the password is always better than using complex characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Never Reuse Passwords&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be tempting to use the same password across multiple services since that makes them easier to remember, but attackers are constantly targeting popular websites and services in order to gain access to user accounts and personal information. If an attacker gains access to your Facebook account, they shouldn’t be able to use those credentials to log in to your work email or personal banking site. Use a unique password for each account you have. And keep in mind that just changing the number at the end of the password or making other tiny tweaks does not equal a unique password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Use a Password Manager&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read recommendations one and two and thought, “Yeah, yeah, but how do I remember all those complex, unique passwords?”, here’s a tip. Use a password manager. &lt;a href="https://www.lastpass.com/"&gt;LastPass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://1password.com/"&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt; are two great options. LastPass is free for personal use and 1Password is very affordable. Both make using long, unique passphrases easy, but the benefits don’t stop there. You can sync passwords across your devices, audit your passwords for reuse, and set policies to ensure you are following the best practices we recommend. Additionally, when using a password manager, we recommend that you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a good master password that you can remember! This password is extremely important because it allows access to all your credentials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up two-factor authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure the password manager to use long phrases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Audit Your Accounts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now you have an awesome password strategy, but what about those pre-existing accounts that might be using weak passwords or that have already been compromised in one of the many data breaches over the years? You can audit your accounts with &lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/"&gt;Have I Been Pwned?&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to search across data breaches to see if your email address has been compromised. This way, if any of your accounts have been compromised as part of breach, you’ll know and can change the password immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Use Two-Factor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will talk in depth about why it’s so important in the future, but always enable two-factor authentication for all accounts that support it. Popular services such as Gmail, Office365, Facebook, Twitter all have two-factor support. This is a great way to ensure that attackers can’t easily access your account, even if they somehow swipe your password. As an IT manager, requiring two-factor authentication will help prevent unauthorized access to the services your business depends on if your employee’s accounts are compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. Educate Your Employees&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Businesses must remember that employees are the first line of defense against credential theft. Take the time to educate and train people to recognize phishing and attempts to steal their credentials. One easy way to do so? Share this article about managing your credentials like a security professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you have it. You don’t have to be a security professional to protect your usernames and passwords like one. Follow these six simple steps and you’ll be well on your way to preventing the next credential phishing attack.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="phishing"></category><category term="security"></category><category term="passwords"></category></entry></feed>

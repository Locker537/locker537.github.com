*And so it begins...*

I wrote an article titled **Attending Your First HPDE (And so it begins...)** for the June 2020 issue of The NOR'EASTER, a magazine written, edited, and published by the Northeast Region of the Porsche Club of America. You can read this article in the [digital edition of the June 2020 issue here](https://porschenet.com/the-online-noreaster/) or [download the June 2020 issue as a PDF](https://porschenet.com/noreaster/2006/pca-ner-noreaster-2006.pdf).
